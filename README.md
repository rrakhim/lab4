# Lab 4
'catkin_ws' is a main folder for ROS that I used.
1. In catkin_ws/src/ros_snake_robot/ there is my 'moveit_rs' folder with all "setup" files (e.g., .yaml, .launch).
2. In catkin_ws/src/ there is my main package 'moveit_rs_test'. Inside of its 'src' folder there are two .cpp files, for drawing a line and for drawing a rectangle. Each one contains comments and explanations of the code, so please consult it.
